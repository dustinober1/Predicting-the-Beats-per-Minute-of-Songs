## Data Description

Each dataset contains audio features that can be used to predict the BPM (beats per minute) of music tracks.

## Usage

1. **Raw data** in `raw/` should not be modified
2. **Processed data** in `processed/` is generated by the feature engineering scripts
3. Both directories have their own README files with detailed descriptions
