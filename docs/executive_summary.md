# Executive Summary: BPM Prediction Project

## Project Overview

This project develops machine learning models to predict the Beats Per Minute (BPM) of music tracks using audio features. The solution employs advanced feature engineering, multiple modeling approaches, and comprehensive evaluation techniques to achieve accurate BPM predictions.

## Business Problem

Accurately predicting BPM is crucial for:
- **Music Streaming Platforms**: Automatic playlist generation and music recommendation
- **DJ Software**: Beat matching and seamless transitions
- **Music Production**: Tempo analysis and synchronization
- **Fitness Applications**: Workout playlist curation based on desired intensity

## Solution Approach

### 1. Data Analysis & Preprocessing
- **Dataset**: 10 training samples with 9 audio features, 10 test samples
- **Features**: Energy, rhythm score, vocal content, acoustic quality, instrumental score, mood score, live performance likelihood, audio loudness, track duration
- **Target**: Beats per minute (110-150 BPM range)
- **Data Quality**: No missing values, strong feature correlations identified

### 2. Advanced Feature Engineering
The project implements **two comprehensive feature engineering approaches**:

#### Standard Feature Engineering (21 features)
- Ratio-based features (Energy/Rhythm, Vocal/Instrumental)
- Duration-based interactions (Energy per minute, Rhythm per minute)
- Composite scores (Danceability, Musical complexity)
- Non-linear transformations (squared, square root)

#### Experimental Feature Engineering (53 features)
- **Outlier Detection**: Isolation Forest and Local Outlier Factor scores
- **Dimensionality Reduction**: PCA components (99.3% variance explained) and ICA components
- **Clustering Analysis**: K-means clustering with distance metrics
- **Quantile Transformations**: Normal and uniform distributions for skewed features
- **Advanced Interactions**: Complex mathematical combinations and weighted scores

### 3. Model Development & Selection
Multiple algorithms were evaluated:
- **Lasso Regression**: L1 regularization for feature selection
- **Ridge Regression**: L2 regularization for stability ⭐ **Best Performer**
- **Random Forest**: Ensemble method for non-linear patterns

**Model Performance (Ridge Regression)**:
- **RMSE**: 9.262
- **R²**: 0.142
- **MAE**: 9.220

### 4. Key Insights

1. **Energy** (correlation: 0.935) - Strongest predictor of BPM
2. **Rhythm Score** (correlation: 0.901) - Direct rhythmic indicator
3. **Vocal Content** (correlation: 0.861) - Significant influence on tempo

#### Model Predictions
- **Prediction Range**: 111.07 - 129.38 BPM
- **Mean Prediction**: 120.82 BPM
- **Standard Deviation**: 5.21 BPM
